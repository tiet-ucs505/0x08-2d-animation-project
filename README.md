AIR HOCKEY GAME


We have built a simple, two-player, Air Hockey game in which one player will be the user and the other will be the computer. Just like in real Air Hockey , both the players tries to score by putting the ball in the opponent's goal by using their pucks 
Whomsoever successfully scores 3 points first would be declared the winner and the game would end there.
The game is primarily developed using HTML Canvas and Mouse handling events in JavaScript . For the computer part a simple AI algorithm is implemented.
